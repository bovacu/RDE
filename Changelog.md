# This is the changelog of the engine (created the 07/03/2023 dd/mm/yyyy) and I will be posting in here the updates to have a clear vision on the additions and improvements of the engine

### Changelog 0.1.0 (07/03/2023) This is the first changelog and I will add some of the features, not all.
- Project compiling on:
  - Windows: Clang and Visual Studio
  - Mac: G++ and Clang

- Python script to compile and run the project on any desktop plaform
- TexturePacker (Free Edition) exporting tool to create the neccessary files to load SpriteSheets
- Default assets for the engine to load in case of no Texture inputs
- Separated modules for non-desktop platforms:
  - Android: own module with its own compilation and exporting script. Working correctly.
  - iOS: own module with its own compilation and exporting script. Now it works with provisioning certificate and needs to be renewed each 7 days, but is working
- Android ads module implemented and working on the most basic examples and tests. Need to improve a lot the integration and API

  - Can modify attributes of different components
  - Show statistics of the engine
  - Enable or disable some features (mostly debugging)
  - Small and simple console (will be improved a lot)
- Spritebatching system for better and more efficent 2D rendering
- System to integrate and use your own Shaders. Needs better API and also documentation
